# StarRating Component

The `StarRating` component allows users to rate something using stars. Users can click on a star to set their rating or hover over stars to preview a rating.

## How It Works

1. **State Management**:

   - `rating`: Keeps track of the user's rating.
   - `hover`: Tracks which star is being hovered over.

2. **Event Handlers**:

   - **`handleClick(getCurrentIndex)`**: Updates the rating when a star is clicked. It sets the `rating` to the index of the clicked star plus one.
   - **`handleMouseHover(getCurrentIndex)`**: Highlights stars up to the index of the hovered star. It sets the `hover` state to the index of the hovered star plus one.
   - **`handleMouseLeave()`**: Resets the highlight when the mouse leaves the star area.

3. **Rendering Stars**:
   - **`[...Array(noOfstart)]`**: Creates an array with `noOfstart` `undefined` values. This array is used to generate the star elements.
   - **`map((_, index) => (...))`**: Iterates over the array and renders a `FaStar` component for each index.
   - **`className`**: Determines the style of the star based on whether it’s active (highlighted) or inactive.
   - **`onClick`, `onMouseMove`, `onMouseLeave`**: Assigns event handlers for click, hover, and mouse leave events.

## Styling

- **`star-active`**: Applied to stars that are currently active or highlighted.
- **`star-inactive`**: Applied to stars that are not active.

This component provides an interactive star rating system where users can click to set a rating and hover to preview ratings.
