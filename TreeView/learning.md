# Understanding the Menu Components

## 1. **TreeView Component**

```javascript
import MenuList from "./menuList";
import "./style.css";

export default function TreeView({ menus = [] }) {
  return (
    <div className="tree-view-container">
      <MenuList list={menus} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

# What It Does:

The `TreeView` component is like a big box that holds a list of menu items. Imagine it as a container that shows all the main options (like "Home," "Profile," "Settings") that you can click on.

# How It Works:

- It takes a list of menu items (called `menus`) and passes them to another component called `MenuList`.
- If no menu items are provided, it uses an empty list by default.
- The `TreeView` just sets up the space where the menu will be shown.

## 2. **MenuItem Component**

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";
import MenuList from "./menuList";
import { FaMinus, FaPlus } from "react-icons/fa";

export default function MenuItem({ item }) {
  const [displayCurrentChildren, setDisplayCurrentChildren] = useState({});

  function handleToggleChildren(getCurrentlabel) {
    setDisplayCurrentChildren({
      ...displayCurrentChildren,
      [getCurrentlabel]: !displayCurrentChildren[getCurrentlabel],
    });
  }

  console.log(displayCurrentChildren);

  return (
    <li>
      <div className="menu-item">
        <p>{item.label}</p>
        {item && item.children && item.children.length ? (
          <span onClick={() => handleToggleChildren(item.label)}>
            {displayCurrentChildren[item.label] ? (
              <FaMinus color="#fff" size={25} />
            ) : (
              <FaPlus color="#fff" size={25} />
            )}
          </span>
        ) : null}
      </div>

      {item &&
      item.children &&
      item.children.length > 0 &&
      displayCurrentChildren[item.label] ? (
        <MenuList list={item.children} />
      ) : null}
    </li>
  );
}
```

# What It Does:

The `MenuItem` component represents a single menu item, like "Profile" or "Settings." If this item has sub-options (like "Details" under "Profile"), it can expand to show them or collapse to hide them.

# How It Works:

- It uses a `useState` hook to keep track of whether the sub-options are visible.
- When you click on the item, it shows or hides the sub-options. For example, clicking "Profile" can reveal or hide "Details."
- If there are sub-options, it shows either a plus (`+`) or minus (`-`) icon to indicate whether the list is expanded or collapsed.
- If the item has children (sub-options), it calls `MenuList` to display them underneath.

## 3. **MenuList Component**

```javascript
import MenuItem from "./menuItem";

export default function MenuList({ list = [] }) {
  return (
    <ul className="menu-list-container">
      {list && list.length
        ? list.map((listItem) => <MenuItem item={listItem} />)
        : null}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

# What It Does:

The `MenuList` component takes a list of menu items and displays them as a list. Each item in this list is handled by the `MenuItem` component.

# How It Works:

- It receives a list of menu items.
- It goes through each item in the list and creates a `MenuItem` for each one.
- If the list is empty, nothing is shown.

## 4. **The `menus` Array**

# What It Is:

This is the list of all the menu items you have. It's like a map of your entire menu structure, including the main items and their sub-items.

# How It Works:

- **Home:** A simple menu item that links to the homepage.
- **Profile:** A menu item that has sub-options like "Details," which also has its own sub-options like "Location" and "City."
- **Settings:** A menu item with sub-options like "Account" and "Security." "Security" has more sub-options like "Login" and "Register."

## 5. **How They Work Together**

- **TreeView**: The starting point that holds the entire menu.
  - Calls **MenuList** to display the list of menu items.
- **MenuList**: Displays each menu item in the list.
  - Calls **MenuItem** for each item.
- **MenuItem**: Shows each item and handles expanding or collapsing if the item has sub-options.
  - Calls **MenuList** again if the item has children (sub-options).

# Example Flow:

- `TreeView` starts with the `menus` list.
- It passes this list to `MenuList`, which goes through each menu item.
- For "Profile," `MenuItem` shows "Profile" and then calls `MenuList` to display its sub-items, like "Details."
- The process continues down the chain, showing and hiding items as needed.
